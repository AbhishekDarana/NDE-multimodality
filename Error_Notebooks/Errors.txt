1)cover_depth_measurement_Mississipi_11002200250005A------ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity

This error is while finding actually co-ordinates to plot the cover depth


-------------------
Errors that can be solved
nums of clusters is 100 by default and if samples are less than 100, have to adjust it in notebook


-------------------
Fixed bugs---

Lanes make reions/ zones. Zones make the entire bridge

Lanes if not marked in sequence(Example- 0,1,2,3,4) it didn't pick in corrosion_notebook_Mississipi_11002200250005A notebook

SOLVED by renaming data to fall in sequence.
